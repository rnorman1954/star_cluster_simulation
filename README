Introduction
============
This suite of programmes creates a star cluster, simulates the motion of the stars due to their gravitational interactions over a period of time, plots their positions at various intervals, and creates an animation of their movements.

Many of the routines are based on the "The Art of Computer Science" (http://www.artcompsci.org/).

1.  Create a file with the masses, initial positions and initial velocities of the objects (planets, stars).
    Maybe use the createCluster programme to create a random cluster of stars.
    Call this file ?????.in (ie input file).

2.  Use the nbody1 programme to calculate the subsequent evolution of the system.  Call the output file ?????.out

3.  Use the createAnimation programme to create a series of images of the output data.

4.  Use the ImageMagick module "convert" to combine the separate images into an animated gif.
    ie.  convert *.png file.gif

There are more detailed instructions at the start of the source code for each programme.

Compiling
=========
The 'Makefile' will compile the source code and create the binaries inside the 'build' folder.
